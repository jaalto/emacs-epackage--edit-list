Description: interactively edit a list variable easily
 So you've just added an incorrect entry to auto-mode-alist and want
 to fix it quickly.  `M-x edit-list RET auto-mode-alist RET' to the
 rescue.  Make your changes and hit either `C-x C-s' or `C-c C-c'
 when done.  Or just kill the buffer if you change your mind.
